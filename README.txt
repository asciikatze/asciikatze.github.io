++ i'm here to learn about web developement and to try github ++

+ design direction:
think about how people with disabilities interact with the site.
when implement scripts test without them.
audit image/file metadata before hosting.

+ how it works:
style.js  decides between two css depending on client time.
line.js   shows a random line from a list.
katze.js  animation of ascii cat.

+ comments:
test the asciiart on different devices because the character font can be different.

+ license:
idk... all rights reserved where applicable
