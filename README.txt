personal website so i can learn about web developement / trying out github

design direction:
try to mask relevant information from webcrawlers.
when implement scripts test without them.
audit image/file metadata before hosting.
have fun; don't stress about it.
less is more.

how it works:
style.js  decides between two css depending on browser time.
line.js   shows a random line from a list.
katze.js  animation of ascii cat.

comments:
think about how people with disabilities interact with the site.
test the asciiart on different devices becouse the character font can be different.
